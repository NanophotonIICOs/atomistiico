# AtomistIICO Repository Overview

Welcome to the AtomistIICO Repository!

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of scripts for Quantum Espresso, YAMBO and GPAW, designed to facilitate the post-processing of data from computational physics and materials science simulations.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this repository are:
* To Share Useful Scripts: A curated set of scripts tailored for Quantum Espresso and GPAW users.
* To Streamline Post-Processing: Simplify and enhance the post-processing steps involved in computational data analysis.
* To Foster Collaboration: Encourage collaboration and contributions from the community to expand and improve the script collection.
